                <p> <strong>At $6,010,000, this guitar has great value</strong></p>
                <p>If there’s one Kurt Cobain guitar moment that’s become even more iconic than the Teen Spirit video, 
                    it’s Nirvana’s incredible, bittersweet performance on MTV Unplugged. Kurt bought the D-18E in 1992 at Voltage Guitars in Los Angeles, 
                    and it’s a rare bird for Martin guitars in that it came out of the factory with the DeArmond pickups, but Kurt disliked their sound and 
                    had it modded with a Bartolini 3AV soundhole pickup. The guitar was left to Kurt’s daughter Francis Bean, and then ended up with her 
                    ex-husband Isaiah Silva as part of their divorce settlement. The guitar was purchased by RØDE Microphones founder, Peter Freedman in 
                    2020 – and it’s not been topped since.

                <p><strong>Do you think you could afford this at $4,550,000?</strong></p>
                <p>What does an iconic moment in guitar history cost? About four and a half million dollars it turns out. 
                    It’s not an exaggeration to say that the Smells Like Teen Spirit music video changed the world, 
                    and in it Kurt Cobain is playing a rather fetching but typically unconventional lefty Lake Placid Blue Mustang with a 
                    competition strip – 1.5 billion YouTube views and countless hours of MTV airtime later, its place in the pop culture 
                    firmament was assured. Ironically, the guitar wasn’t really one of Kurt’s favourites, only really getting a run-out 
                    live on a few other occasions but its place in the Teen Spirit video assured its place in rock history, and in the 
                    Jim Irsay collection in 2022.

                <h2>David Gilmour’s Black Fender Stratocaster $3,975,000</h2>
                <img src="/imgs/David-Gilmour.jpg" class="third-image" alt="Expensive black electric guitar">
                <p> <strong>For the low price of $3,975,000 this guitar could be yours!</strong></p>
                <p>The Black Strat is David Gilmour’s most iconic guitar and is also one that’s been heavily modified over the years
                     – bought from Manny’s Music in New York, this 1968 model was originally Sunburst but had been refinished in Black 
                     by the time Gilmour bought it in 1970. It originally had a maple neck with a late-60s big headstock, but throughout 
                     the 70s Gilmour frequently swapped between two 50s necks, one with rosewood and maple. That wasn’t the end – over the
                      decades since the pickups, tuners, pots, trem and scratchplate have all been swapped, and in fact it’s now estimated 
                      that the only original parts of the guitar remaining are the body, selector switch and (maybe) the bridge plate. 
                      Despite this, the Black Strat remains Gilmour’s most iconic instrument.
