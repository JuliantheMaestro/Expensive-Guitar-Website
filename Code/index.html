                <p> <strong>At $6,010,000, this guitar has great value</strong></p>
                <p>If there’s one Kurt Cobain guitar moment that’s become even more iconic than the Teen Spirit video, 
                    it’s Nirvana’s incredible, bittersweet performance on MTV Unplugged. Kurt bought the D-18E in 1992 at Voltage Guitars in Los Angeles, 
                    and it’s a rare bird for Martin guitars in that it came out of the factory with the DeArmond pickups, but Kurt disliked their sound and 
                    had it modded with a Bartolini 3AV soundhole pickup. The guitar was left to Kurt’s daughter Francis Bean, and then ended up with her 
                    ex-husband Isaiah Silva as part of their divorce settlement. The guitar was purchased by RØDE Microphones founder, Peter Freedman in 
                    2020 – and it’s not been topped since.

                <h2>Kurt Cobain’s Smells Like Teen Spirit Fender Mustang $4,550,000</h2>
                <img src="/imgs/Kurt-Cobain2.jpg" class="second-image" alt="Kurt Cobains black fender mustang">
                <p><strong>Do you think you could afford this at $4,550,000?</strong></p>
                <p>What does an iconic moment in guitar history cost? About four and a half million dollars it turns out. 
                    It’s not an exaggeration to say that the Smells Like Teen Spirit music video changed the world, 
                    and in it Kurt Cobain is playing a rather fetching but typically unconventional lefty Lake Placid Blue Mustang with a 
                    competition strip – 1.5 billion YouTube views and countless hours of MTV airtime later, its place in the pop culture 
                    firmament was assured. Ironically, the guitar wasn’t really one of Kurt’s favourites, only really getting a run-out 
                    live on a few other occasions but its place in the Teen Spirit video assured its place in rock history, and in the 
                    Jim Irsay collection in 2022.
