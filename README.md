This is a website designed to bolster my CSS skills. I learned many news skills including the semantics of html which I had no idea about and using hyperlinks instead of button elements for simple navigation across the page. I learned how to use div elements properly and how to make better uses of flexbox.  

I added an additional feature with Javascript for fun. When the user tries to scroll down the webpage an annoying pop up shows after a few seconds. The user is unable to exit out of the pop-up or hit the decline button until they enter their information. The Javascript involved features the setTimeout method, modifying the innerhtml as well as toggling the classlist of the buttons so they user can't hit decline.
